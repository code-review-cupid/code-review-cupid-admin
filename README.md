## Overview

The purpose of Code Review Cupid is to build the community of code reviewers and those who are searching for help to review the code. The idea behind the community is that anybody who works at the intersection of software engineering and any particular scientific domain (the latter being dependent on software and its quality) can offer expertise in software technologies to other academic colleagues. Therefore, we can help each other to create a better and a more maintainable research software. So, this website is geared towards building such a community. 

## How to become a part of the community of code reviewers

In the industry field, code reviews are standard practices to guarantee software quality. However, it is very rare in academia. Generally, researchers are more focused on the output of the code rather than the quality of code. which makes the code extension, readability, repeatability, and maintainability cannot be satisfied. Therefore, we aim to build a community of academic code reviews, bringing the development of quality software at the core of a researcherâ€™s routine.
