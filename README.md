## Overview

The purpose of Code Review Cupid is to build the community of code reviewers and those who are searching for help to review the code. The idea behind the community is that anybody who works at the intersection of software engineering and any particular scientific domain (the latter being dependent on software and its quality) can offer expertise in software technologies to other academic colleagues. Therefore, we can help each other to create a better and a more maintainable research software. So, this website is geared towards building such a community.
